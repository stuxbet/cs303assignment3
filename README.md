 Implemented the Queue data structure(using a linked list) with push(), pop(), front(), size() and empty() functions. 
 The queue is a template class (should work with any data type). 
 
 Performs the following operations:
a) Instantiate the queue with integers and push 10 values into the queue
b) Display all the elements in a queue using just the queue functions mentioned above
(push, pop, front, size etc.)
c) function called move_to_rear that moves the element currently at
the front of the queue to the rear of the queue.

this program has a recursive linear search function with a recursive step that finds the last
occurrence of a target in a vector, not the first. 

this program also has insertion sort so that it can sort a list of integers
